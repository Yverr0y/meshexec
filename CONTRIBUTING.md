Contributors are very welcome! **No contribution is too small and all contributions are valued.**

## License

Automesh is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE). You are free to use, modify, and distribute this software as permitted by the license.

## Rust

You'll need to have the stable Rust toolchain installed in order to develop Automesh. The minimum supported Rust version is **1.89.0**.

The Rust toolchain (stable) can be installed via rustup using the following command:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This will install `rustup`, `rustc` and `cargo`. For more information, refer to the [official Rust installation documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Commitizen
[Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen-tools/commitizen?tab=readme-ov-file) is a nifty tool that helps us write better commit messages. It ensures that our
commits have a consistent style and makes it easier to generate CHANGELOGS. Additionally,
Commitizen is used to run pre-commit checks to enforce style constraints.

To install `commitizen` and the `pre-commit` prerequisite, run the following command:

```shell
python3 -m pip install commitizen pre-commit
```

### Commitizen Quick Guide
To see an example commit to get an idea for the Commitizen style, run:

```shell
cz example
```

To see the allowed types of commits and their descriptions, run:

```shell
cz info
```

If you'd like to create a commit using Commitizen with an interactive prompt to help you get
comfortable with the style, use:

```shell
cz commit
```

## Setup Workspace

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `cargo test` to verify your setup
3. Make changes
4. Build the application using `just build` or `cargo build`
   - Install `just` (`cargo install just`) if you haven't already to use the [justfile](./justfile) in this project.
5. Commit changes. This will trigger pre-commit hooks that will run format, test and lint. If there are errors or warnings from Clippy, please fix them.
6. Push your code to a new branch named after the feature/bug/etc. you're adding
7. Create a PR

### CI/CD Testing with Act
If you also are planning on testing out your changes before pushing them with [Act](https://github.com/nektos/act), you will need to set up `act`,
`docker`, and configure your local system to run different architectures:

1. Install `docker` by following the instructions on the [official Docker installation page](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Install `act` by following the instructions on the [official Act installation page](https://nektosact.com/installation/index.html).
3. Install `binfmt` on your system once so that `act` can run the correct architecture for the CI/CD workflows.
   You can do this by running:
   ```shell
   sudo docker run --rm --privileged tonistiigi/binfmt --install all
   ```

Then, you can run workflows locally without having to commit and see if the GitHub action passes or fails.

**For example**: To test the [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml) workflow locally, you can run:

```shell
act -W .github/workflows/release.yml --input_type bump=minor
```
